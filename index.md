# Welcome to my blog to discuss connecting custom domain and how to make them work!

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the problems I have been having getting started using GiHub as the host for my custom dmain site.

GitHub has many short instrucitons on how to deal with errors and problems and rules, but does not have a step-by-step set of instructions to get connected.

I know that the site that maintains the custom domain sites are all very different, so they need to be dealt with individually. however, I need to know how to 
initialize the GitHub site to be ready to be used...
